In addition to paper-based textual records, many of the collections contain photographs, motion picture films, videotapes, and sound recordings. Increasingly, the collections include born digital documents in a wide variety of formats.\r\n\r\nThe collections are particularly rich in the areas of technology, consumer culture including advertising and marketing, invention and innovation, popular music, African American history and culture, and many other topics that document the American experience.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, Archives Center collections are acquired by donation,\n...\noften in conjunction with the acquisition of related artifacts and in collaboration with the Museum's curatorial staff.  Documentation projects -- including oral and video histories -- actively create new research collections.  The Museum's ability to acquire and care for artifacts and archival materials in all physical formats and to generate contemporary documentation gives it a unique capacity to record the complexity and richness of the American experience.\nShow more\nShow less\nConnections working at Archives Center, National Museum of American History\nhttps://careers.archivists.org/jobs/21949578/lemelson-center-graduate-student-archival-internship\nReturn to Search Results\nLoading.
