Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and over 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.\nThe scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors, 100 minors, and 200 advanced degree programs offered across the University\u2019s 13 schools and colleges; over 15,000 undergraduates and over 6,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit http://www.syracuse.edu.\nAbout the Syracuse area:\nSyracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.\nApplication Deadline:\nFull Consideration By:\nTo apply, visit\nhttps://www.sujobopps.com/postings/111481\nSyracuse University is an equal-opportunity institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.\nSyracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University\u2019s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.\nCopyright \u00a92025 Jobelephant.com Inc.

It offers its students a broad curriculum embracing the arts, humanities, literature, foreign languages, social sciences, and natural sciences. Middlebury is an institution with a long-standing international focus, a place where education reflects a sense of looking outward, and a realization that the traditional insularity of the United States is something of the past. We seek to bring to Middlebury those who wish not only to learn about themselves and their own traditions, but also to see beyond the bounds of class, culture, region, or nation. Indeed, the central purpose of a Middlebury education is precisely to transcend oneself and one's own concerns. This transcendence may come for some through the study of other cultures; for some through the study of the environment; for others it will come through inquiry into such fields as physics or philosophy, mathematics or music.\nMiddlebury's undergraduate college is enriched by its other programs. Every summer, the main campus in Vermont is transformed into an institution single-mindedly devoted to the study of nine foreign languages and cultures, and the use of English is virtually banned for the participants, among whom are many Middlebury undergraduates. In the Green Mountains lies Middlebury's Bread Loaf campus, where for six weeks each summer the Bread Loaf School of English is in session. This is followed by the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, which brings together 200 authors and aspiring authors for 11 days of intensive exchange about the art of writing. The Bread Loaf School of English is in session each summer not only in Middlebury but also at Lincoln College, Oxford, in the United Kingdom; at St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and at the University of North Carolina at Asheville\nThere is also an overseas dimension to Middlebury College. The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad are located in Belo Horizonte, Berlin, Bordeaux, Buenos Aires, Concepci\u00f3n, C\u00f3rdoba, Ferrara, Florence, Getafe, Guadalajara, Hangzhou, Irkutsk, La Serena, Logro\u00f1o, Madrid, Mainz, Montevideo, Moscow, Niter\u00f3i, Paris, Poitiers, Santiago, Temuco, Tucum\u00e1n, Valdivia, Valpara\u00edso, Xalapa, and Yaroslavl. These schools enroll more than 300 undergraduate and graduate students who seek to further their foreign language skills and immerse themselves as fully as possible in the host culture through academic study as well as direct experience.",

Over 120 years later, our institution continues to produce talented alumni and draws faculty and staff eager to be a part of the university's creative, passionate and close-knit community. We place emphasis on practical problem solving, interdisciplinary learning, an entrepreneurial spirit, and collaboration.\nOver the past 10 years, more than 400 startups linked to CMU have raised more than $7 billion in follow-on funding. Those investment numbers are especially high because of the sheer size of Pittsburgh\u2019s growing autonomous vehicles cluster \u2013 including Uber, Aurora, Waymo and Motional \u2013 all of which are here because of their strong ties to CMU.\nWith cutting-edge brain science, path-breaking performances, innovative startups, driverless cars, big data, big ambitions, Nobel and Turing prizes, hands-on learning, and a whole lot of robots, CMU doesn't imagine the future, we create it.\nPittsburgh is home to over 86,000 students from\n10 colleges and universities\n. Pittsburgh was ranked as one of the\ntop U.S. cities for millennials\n.\nSome 177,000 people work in Pittsburgh's tech-related industries, and their ranks continue to grow as the\ncity tops lists for jobs\n. Networking opportunities,\nsmall business accelerators\n, and an innovative community\nmake the city appealing to entrepreneurs\n, especially recent graduates.\nPittsburgh is emerging as a tech and culture hub that The Washington Post praises for its \"\nworld-class art museums and colorful neighborhoods\n.\"\nRobotics\nand software engineering lead the way. The city is home to\nGoogle\n,\nUber\nand\nApple\noffices and a budding ecosystem of tech startups including\nDuolingo\n,\nModcloth\nand\n4Moms\n, all of which have CMU roots.\nMany seek Pittsburgh for being a\nhot spot for entrepreneurship\nand a\nmodel for future cities\n. Others come for the city's\nburgeoning food scene\n.\nYou\u2019ll find CMU locations nationwide \u2014 and worldwide. Silicon Valley. Qatar. Africa. Washington, D.C. To name a few.\nIf your heart is in your work, come work with us.\nCarnegie Mellon University isn't just one of the world\u2019s most renowned educational institutions \u2014 it\u2019s also a hotspot for some of the most talented doers, dreamers and difference-makers on the planet.
